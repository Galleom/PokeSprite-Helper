This is a collection of helper scripts for my 
[branch of PokeSprite](https://github.com/Galleom/pokesprite), in order to use them
in my [website project](https://github.com/Galleom/PokeChecker).

Wanted to share because it also includes various databases
in excel/scv format I used to fill in the database for the website.

I couldn't find pokemon availability databases anywhere in this format, 
so hopefully someone else finds it useful.
